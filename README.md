Kabsa is a traditional Saudi Arabian dish that is popular throughout the Middle East. 
It consists of rice, vegetables,and meat cooked together in a flavorful spice blend. 


Here's how you can make it:

Ingredients:

- 2 cups basmati rice
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 kg chicken or lamb, cut into pieces
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp cardamom
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp turmeric
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cups water

Directions:


- Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain.
- Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
- Add the garlic, tomatoes, and bell pepper and cook for another 5 minutes.
- Add the meat to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
- Add the spices to the pot and stir until everything is coated.
- Add the rice to the pot and stir until it is coated in the spice mixture.
- Pour in the water and bring everything to a boil.
- Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed.
- Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot.
