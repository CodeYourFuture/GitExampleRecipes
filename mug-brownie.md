I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try and was blown away by how delicious it was. It was warm, gooey, and chocolatey - everything I wanted in a brownie. From that day on, mug brownies became my go-to dessert whenever I needed a quick pick-me-up.
I still make mug brownies whenever I want a tasty treat without the hassle of baking a full batch of brownies.
