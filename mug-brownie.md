I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

What you need
=============

* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 tbsp cocoa
* A pinch of salt
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp water
* 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Steps
=====

1. Add all the dry ingredients to a mug.
2. Add the oil and water.
3. Mix until everything is mixed together well.
4. Microwave for 1 minute 40 seconds.
5. The brownie has risen and set on top but is still slightly gooey in the middle.
6. Let the brownie cool for a minute or two before eating. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream, or your favorite toppings, if desired.
