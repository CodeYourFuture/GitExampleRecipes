I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

//Story about how the Brownie was discovered

Once upon a time, there was a software developer named Alex who loved to code in JavaScript. However, he also had a sweet tooth and loved to snack on delicious treats while he worked. One day, Alex found himself craving a brownie but didn't want to go through the trouble of making a full batch in the oven. That's when he had an idea: what if he could make a brownie in the microwave?

Alex had never attempted to make a brownie in the microwave before, so he began to experiment with different ingredients and proportions. He tried using eggs, but found that they made the brownie too rubbery. He tried using butter, but it made the brownie too greasy. Finally, he stumbled upon the perfect combination of ingredients: sugar, flour, cocoa, salt, olive oil, and water.

After a few attempts, Alex had finally perfected the recipe. He loved how simple it was to make and how delicious the end result tasted. He even found himself skipping the microwave step at times and eating the brownie mix raw, since it didn't contain any eggs and therefore wasn't a salmonella risk.

Alex shared his recipe with friends and family, who were amazed by how easy and tasty it was. Soon enough, word spread and the recipe became a sensation among the software development community. People all over the world were making Alex's famous microwave brownies and loving every bite.

And that's how a software developer named Alex stumbled upon the perfect recipe for a microwave brownie. It just goes to show that sometimes the best ideas come from unexpected places!
